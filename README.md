# MutRoSe-self-tutorials

Trying to teach myself MutRoSe for my master's!

First, you need the binary from [LESUnB's repository](https://github.com/lesunb/MutRoSe-Mission-Decomposer), which I will commit here, but I feel it really shouldn't on projects, but anyway, tutorial time!

Each robotic mission has its forder with its name on it, and each folder has the folders configuration, gm, hddl, knowledge and output.
